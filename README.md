## 🤖 My AI Usage

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, following transparent and responsible AI usage practices.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Copilot / Claude (Anthropic)**: Used as a pair programming assistant throughout development

### How AI Was Used

1. **Project Structure & Boilerplate**
   - Generated initial project setup including folder structure, TypeScript configuration, and package.json files
   - Created boilerplate for Express server, middleware, and route handlers

2. **Model Definitions**
   - Assisted in designing Mongoose schemas for User and Sweet models
   - Helped implement password hashing and comparison methods

3. **API Development**
   - Generated controller and service layer code structure
   - Helped implement JWT authentication middleware
   - Assisted with input validation using express-validator

4. **Test Writing**
   - Generated comprehensive test suites for authentication and sweet endpoints
   - Helped set up Jest configuration and test utilities

5. **Frontend Development**
   - Created React component structures and styling with Tailwind CSS
   - Implemented React Router configuration
   - Generated context providers for state management
   - Designed responsive UI components

6. **Documentation**
   - Helped create this comprehensive README file
   - Generated API documentation examples

### Reflection on AI Impact

Working with AI significantly accelerated the development process:

- **Productivity Boost**: Reduced boilerplate writing time by approximately 60%
- **Code Quality**: AI suggestions often included best practices I might have overlooked
- **Learning**: Exposed me to new patterns and approaches in TypeScript and React
- **Debugging**: Helpful in identifying potential issues before they occurred

However, AI assistance required:
- **Critical Review**: Every suggestion was reviewed and modified as needed
- **Context Setting**: Clear prompts were necessary for useful outputs
- **Manual Testing**: All AI-generated code was thoroughly tested
- **Business Logic**: Core application logic required human understanding

The AI served as an intelligent assistant, but final decisions and quality assurance remained my responsibility.
